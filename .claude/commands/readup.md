Read all project documentation to get up to speed.

Instructions:
1. Read CLAUDE.md first (project guidance)
2. Read README.md (project overview)
3. Read all files in docs/*.md
4. Summarize:
   - What this project does
   - Current state (what's implemented)
   - Any pending work or next steps from docs/TODO.md
5. Ask if there's a specific area to focus on

Keep the summary brief - the user already knows the project.
