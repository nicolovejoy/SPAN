Update documentation for context handoff.

Instructions:
1. Review all recent work in this session (check git diff and git log if helpful)
2. Update or create documentation, keeping it succinct:
   - README.md for project overview
   - docs/*.md for detailed documentation
   - CLAUDE.md for Claude Code guidance
   - Keep total to 6 or fewer .md files
3. Document any pending work or known issues in docs/TODO.md
4. Write clear "Next Steps" section so the next session can continue seamlessly
5. Check if there are uncommitted changes - if so, suggest a commit with a clear message
6. Summarize what was accomplished and what's left to do

Goal: Leave the codebase in a state where context can be safely cleared and work resumed later.
